## How do I use this repository?

If you are a student on BM432, you should not *need* to use this repository, but we make it available in the spirit of open science.

As tutors, we use the code and materials in this repository to generate:

1. standalone HTML files that can be used with MyPlace
2. `Shiny` webapps that can be run by students on their own machines, or at `rstudio.org`

The material is written in `R` using `R Markdown`, and to work with or generate all the materials, we recommend that you install and use `RStudio`.
