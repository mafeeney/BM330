<div id="summary">
- Data is often messy and in a state where it cannot be analysed directly without "cleaning" it.
- It is important for reproducibility that what you do with your data is recorded.
- Using tools like `OpenRefine` can automate and simplify data cleaning, and provide a clear log of the actions that were taken.
  - Logs of data cleaning are valuable supplementary information.
- Data cleaning is often a repetitive task, for single steps (e.g. removing quotes), and for complete data-cleaning pipelines (e.g. cleaning the output from a specific machine). Tools like `OpenRefine` can automate this task and make it reproducible.
- `OpenRefine` *specifically* requires that you write cleaned data to a new file. It aims to maintain *data integrity* and will not allow you to overwrite the original datafile.
</div>

# Setup

To participate in the workshop, or to work through the example in your own time, you will need the following on your own computer:

1. The `OpenRefine` software, installed on your computer
2. The example dataset `esoph.tab`, which can be downloaded to your computer using [this link](https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/BM432/notebooks/data/esoph.tab)

<div id="note">
If you do not already have the `OpenRefine` software installed, please see the [configuration notebook](./configuration.html) for detailed instructions how to obtain and install the tool on your operating system.
</div>

# Introduction

Research data can be collected in a wide variety of ways. Sometimes it is handwritten after human measurement; sometimes it is an electronic file produced by a machine; or a hardcopy printout from some device. These outputs of primary data collection are often termed "raw" data. Raw data, it may not be in a format that can be analysed directly, for all sorts of different reasons. To make it usable for analysis, we must first "clean" it. In this part of the workshop, we will go through a process of "cleaning" data prior to analysis.

We have a table of data in electronic format (filename: `esoph.tab`) that has been collected but is not yet in a form that can be analysed in the second half of the workshop. We will use a program called `OpenRefine` to standardise and clean this data.

## `OpenRefine`

`OpenRefine` is a Java program that runs locally on your own machine. It runs in your web browser, but no internet connection is required. No data or other information is sent to any remote servers. `OpenRefine` *preserves data integrity* and **does not modify or overwrite your data file**; all information is stored in a project file, which you can return to at any time, or use to export a new "clean" dataset.

The actions recorded in your data cleaning activity can be "replayed" on a different dataset. In this way, `OpenRefine` is helpful for standardising and cleaning data for all similar datafiles in a project.

<div id="note">
OpenRefine is very powerful and can do much more than we will cover today. You can find out more about `OpenRefine` at [https://openrefine.org/](https://openrefine.org/).

If you would like more practice using `penRefine`, a longer workshop (from which some of this material was adapted) is provided by Data Carpentry at [https://datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/].
</div>

## `esoph.txt`

<div id="warning">
It is always good practice to know exactly where your dataset comes from, and what it represents. The nature and content of your dataset should guide your cleaning and analysis.
</div>

The file `esoph.txt` describes data from a case-control study of oesophageal cancer in Ille-et-Vilaine, France. The dataset is built-in dataset in `R`, and is derived from the publication below:

> Breslow, N. E. and Day, N. E. (1980) Statistical Methods in Cancer Research. Volume 1: The Analysis of Case-Control Studies. IARC Lyon / Oxford University Press.

The columns of the data describe the following:

1. `agegp`: age group of each patient, in six age-range categories (units: years)
2. `alcgp`: daily alcohol consumption of each patient, in four categories (units: gm/day)
3. `tobgp`: daily tobacco consumption of each patient, in four categories (units: gm/day)
4. `ncases`: number of oesophageal cancer cases observed in each group (count data, discrete)
5. `ncontrols`: number of controls (non-cancer individuals) observed in each group (count data, discrete)

The dataset was further modified by LP to introduce commonly-encountered issues when cleaning data, and can be downloaded from [this link](https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/BM432/notebooks/data/esoph.tab)

# Create a New Project

- Start the `OpenRefine` program
  - `OpenRefine` should start in your browser. If it does not, try one of the following links in your browser: [http://127.0.0.1:3333/](http://127.0.0.1:3333/) or [http://localhost:3333/](http://localhost:3333/), and see the [configuration page](https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/BM432/notebooks/configuration.html).

![]()

- Browse to the location of the `esoph.tab` file.
  - If you have not done so already, you will need to download the dataset from [this link](https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/BM432/notebooks/data/esoph.tab).

- Start a new project
  - Click `Create Project`.
  - Select `Get data from` $\rightarrow$ `This Computer`.
  
![]()
  
- Load in the data
  - Click `Browse` and select the file `esoph.tab`.
  - Click `Open` or double-click the `esoph.tab` filename.
  - Click `Next>>`

![]()

At this point, `OpenRefine` shows a preview of the data. This is a good point to pause and inspect the data to see if `OpenRefine` understood the columns, rows and headers correctly.

![]()

<div id="questions">
1. How many lines of data are identified by `OpenRefine`?
2. How does `OpenRefine` handle the column header row?
</div>

<div id="warning">
If you inspect the `esoph.tab` file in `Notepad` or some other application, you will see that line 28 is incorrectly formatted, because there are two tab characters between the first and second columns:

```text
"35-44"	"40-79"	"20-29"	1	14
"35-44"	"40-79"	"30+"	0	8
"35-44"	"80-119"	"0-9g/day"	0	11
"35-44"	  "80-119"	"10-19"	0	6
"35-44"	"80-119"	"20-29"	0	2
"35-44"	"80-119"	"30+"	0	1
```

`OpenRefine` can detect problems like this automatically, and correct them in the preview, as it does here for `esoph.tab`.
</div>

<div id="note">
This is your first chance to change some of `OpenRefine`'s settings to control how it processes (or *parses*) your data.

To change the options, modify the settings in `Parse data as` $\rightarrow$ `CSV / TSV / separator-based files` and click `Update Preview` (at the bottom right).
</div>

If everything looks OK, you can create the project. But something *doesn't* quite look right.

<div id="warning">
**There are blank rows in the file.**

These rows carry no data and do not help the downstream analysis. They have possibly been introduced as a guide to the reader's eye, so they can see the gaps between age divisions. They are, however, not meaningful in the analysis we want to perform, and should be removed.

**In general, data tables should not contain cosmetic features like font differences, colours, or blank rows or columns for the sake of "readability" or to carry information."" Such decoration should be cleaned from the dataset.
</div>

- Remove blank rows from the dataset
  - Uncheck the box next to `Store blank rows`
  - The preview may update automatically, but if it does not, click `Update Preview`

![]()

<div id="questions">
1. How many rows of data does `OpenRefine` now show?
2. The `OpenRefine` preview does not show the quotes that surround data in cells like `"30+"`. Why do you think this is?
</div>

- Create the project
  - If everything looks OK, click `Create Project>>` (at the top right).

`OpenRefine` now presents its main window with an overview of your data.

# Faceting data

*Facets* are a central feature of `OpenRefine` and allow you to apply multiple filters to inspect your data, prior to cleaning, and to select subsets of the data for cleaning. Facets group all like values that appear in a column, and let you filter and edit the values that appear in that column.

<div id="note">
`OpenRefine` tries to help you with your work. The left panel often includes links to information and videos about how to use the software.
</div>

## Cleaning data columns, using facets

- Inspecting the `agegp` column
  - Click the down arrow next to `agegp` and choose `Facet` $\rightarrow$ `Text facet`.
  - The left panel now contains every unique value in the `agegp` column, and a count of the number of times they occur.
  
![]()
  
<div id="questions">
1. How many unique values are there in the `agegp` column?
2. Do you notice any problems with the data? If so, what are they, and how would you fix them?
<div>

- Fixing the `agegp` column
  - The `45_54` values look to be in error. An underscore (`_`) has been used in place of a dash (`-`).
  - Hover the mouse over the `45_54` category in the left panel. Two options appear: `edit` and `include`. Click `edit`.
  - A window appears, where you can edit the text `45_54`. Change this text to `45-54` and click `Apply`.
  - There is a single instance of `65- 74` that has an extra space, and this appears to be in error.
  - Hover the mouse over `65- 74`, and click `edit`.
  - Change the text in the new window from `65- 74` to `65-74` and click `Apply`
  
<div id="questions">
1. How many unique values are there in the `agegp` column, now?
<div>

# Clustering data

In `OpenRefine`, clustering means "finding groups of different values that might be alternative representations of the same thing." For instance, data might be inconsistently capitalised or abbreviated in a table but refer to the same thing, like "E. coli", "Escherichia coli", and "Escherichia Coli". Technically, these are all different strings so would not be recognised as the same by most analysis tools. `OpenRefine` can detect similarities between these strings, and propose to cluster them all together with the same text.

## Cleaning data columns, using clustering

- Inspecting the `alcgp` column
  - Click the down arrow next to `alcgp` and choose `Facet` $\rightarrow$ `Text Facet`.
  
<div id="note">
To make space, you may have to close the `agegp` facet
</div>

<div id="questions">
1. How many categories are there in the `alcgp` column?
2. Do you notice any problems with the data? If so, what are they, and how would you fix them?

- Fixing the `alcgp` column
  - Click on the `Cluster` button in the `alcgp` facet
  - Note how `OpenRefine` has grouped similar terms. Has it grouped all the similar terms correctly?
  - Check the `Merge?` box for any terms that should be merged, and click `Merge Selected & Re-Cluster`
  - The default settings do not correctly cluster the two entries for `0-39` gm/day, so we need to change the settings.
  - Choose the `nearest neighbour` and `levenshtein` clustering method, with radius `10` and `4` block chars.
  - Check the `Merge?` box for the `0-39` gm/day entries
  
<div id="questions">
1. How many categories are there in the `alcgp` column?
2. Is the data in the `alcgp` column clean yet?
</div>

Notice that only one category has a set of units. For consistency (which is always desirable) could choose here to have units in all categories or none. My preference would be to have no units indicated here, but instead to place units in the header, or in an accompanying metadata file.

- Removing the units
  - Hover the mouse over `0-39g/day` and click `edit`
  - Delete the units and click `Apply`
  
# Cleaning `tobgp`

There are several issues with data in `tobgp`, and we can fix them all using faceting and clustering.

- Create a text facet for `tobgp`
- Cluster the categories using `nearest neighbour`, `ppm` with radius `5` and `4` block chars`
- Select the rows that should be merged and click `Merge Selected & Re-Cluster`
- Cluster the categories using `nearest neighbour`, `ppm` with radius `5` and `3` block chars`
- Select the rows that should be merged and click `Merge Selected & Close`

<div id="questions">
1. How many categories are there in the `alcgp` column?
2. Is the data in the `tobgp` column clean yet?
</div>

# Reproducible cleaning

`OpenRefine` does not modify your data directly. Instead it builds an ordered series of instructions - *a script* - in a "language" called `JSON`^[JSON: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON] that describes the processes applied to the input dataset. This can be "replayed" live within `OpenRefine` using the `Undo/Redo` options in the left panel.

- Viewing the cleaning script
  - Click on `Undo/Redo`
  
<div id="questions">
1. How many steps are applied in the script?
2. Which columns were modified?
3. How many cells were modified each time?
</div>

You can move forwards and backwards in the cleaning process to see the state of the data each time, by clicking on the steps in the left panel.

## Exporting the cleaning script

The instructions in your script can be saved to a file. This can be applied to other files in OpenRefine. If you had several files with similar kinds of errors, you could open the saved file in `OpenRefine` and apply it to the dataset, so that each file is cleaned in *exactly the same way*.

You can attach the file to a publication, report or thesis, as supplementary information, so that all processes in analysing the data for a project are open.

- Viewing your cleaning script
  - In the left panel, click `Extract...`
  - A new window appears. The script is in the right-hand panel
  - Individual steps can be included or excluded by selecting or deselecting the check boxes to the left
  
# Saving and exporting your project and cleaned data

`OpenRefine` saves your project as you go. If you close and reopen `OpenRefine`, your projects will be listed and you can resume any of the projects at any time.

## Exporting your project

Your project includes the raw data and cleaning steps that are applied. You can share this with collaborators, or attach to a paper as supplementary information.

- Exporting the project
  - Click the `Export` button (top right) and select `OpenRefine project archive to file`
  - The standard file download dialogue will appear for your browser
  - The project will be saved as a `.tar.gz` file
  
<div id="warning">
The `.tar.gz` file format may not be familiar to you, but it is a widely-used format for compressing and archiving data.

- On macOS and Linux, the extraction tools are available by default. On macOS, double-clicking the file in `Finder` should extract its contents.
- On Windows, you may need to use additional software such as [`7-zip`](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [`WinZip`](http://www.winzip.com/).
</div>

## Exporting your cleaned data

As `OpenRefine` does not modify your raw data, you will need to export your cleaned data, to take it forward for analysis with other tools.

- Exporting cleaned data
  - Click the `Export` button (top right) and select the file type you want to use to export the data
  - The standard file download dialogue will appear for your browser
  
<div id="note">
Remember that using widely-supported, plain text, open non-proprietary formats like `.tsv`/`.tab` (tab-separated value) or `.csv` (comma-separated value) makes it easier for yourself and others to use your data.
