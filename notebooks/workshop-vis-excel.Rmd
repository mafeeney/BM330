- 1D scatterplots and boxplots are good visualisations of the distribution of a dataset.
  - `Excel` cannot produce a 1D scatterplot easily
  - To produce a boxplot, `Excel` needs data in _wide_ format
  - `Excel` cannot easily convert _long_ format data to _wide_ format data
- Linear regression is a method for fitting a linear model to a relationship between variables
  - `Excel` can fit a basic trendline that is a linear regression model
  - To obtain useful diagnostic statistics, and confidence intervals, the `analysis Toolpak` must be used
- `Excel` plots usually need manual attention to conform to good visualisation guidelines
</div>

# Setup

To work through these examples, you will need the following on your own computer:

1. The datasets (see [this link](./workshop-visualisation.html) for a description)
2. Microsoft `Excel` (you have a licence for this *via* the university)

<div id="note">
- [**Click here to download the `ToothGrowth` dataset**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sipbs-compbiol/BM432/2021/notebooks/data/toothgrowth.tab)
- [**Click here to download the `Prestige` dataset**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sipbs-compbiol/BM432/2021/notebooks/data/prestige.tab)
</div>

## Boxplot

<div id="note">
`Excel` does not have an option to produce a 1D scatterplot, natively. We therefore produce only a boxplot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot)
</div>

<div id="warning">
You cannot easily convert the data in `toothgrowth.tab` to the format you need, in order to create a boxplot, using only `Excel`. The original file presents data in *long* format (one row per observation). To construct a boxplot in `Excel`, the data must be in *wide* format. This requires either a lot of function programming in `Excel`, or the use of the `Power Query` plugin, both of which are beyond the scope of this workshop.

We are instead providing a pre-prepared dataset: `toothgrowth_wide.tab` so that you can construct a boxplot in `Excel`:

</div>

<details>
  <summary>Click here to toggle details of how we modified the data using `R`</summary>

Being a statistical programming package, `R` has several tools for reshaping datasets. We used the `tidyr` package function `pivot_wider` and some `dplyr` convenience functions to modify the data, then save it, using the commands below:

```r
widedata = ToothGrowth %>%
  group_by(supp, dose) %>%
  mutate(row=row_number()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=c(supp, dose), values_from=len)
write.table(widedata, "data/toothgrowth_wide.tab",
  sep="\t", row.names=FALSE)
```
</details>

Our goal is to show how the measured guinea pig tooth growth varies by combination of supplement and supplement dosage. We could approach this in any of several ways, but here we want to treat each supplement as a _category_ or _factor_, and each dosage as a _category_ or _factor_. We'd like to see the distribution of measured tooth lengths _conditioned_ on these explanatory variables.

What we're looking for is a visual representation of the variation in the dataset, for each combination of supplement and dosage. Normally, a 1D scatterplot is a good way to visualise the raw data, with a boxplot/box-and-whisker plot to represent summary statistics. Sadly, `Excel` cannot represent a 1D scatterplot easily, so we only show the box-and-whisker plot.


- Create a new `Blank`Workbook` in Excel

```{r fig-create-blank-excel, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Create a blank workbook in `Excel`"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-01-create_blank.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-02-create_blank.png")
```

- Use `File` $\rightarrow$ `Import` to begin the file import wizard.
- Navigate to and select the `toothgrowth_wide.tab` file

```{r fig-select-toothwide, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Select data file for import"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-03-select_csv.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-04-select_wide.png")
```

- Using the wizard, identify the file delimiter, set the column datatypes, and import the data into the current worksheet.

```{r fig-open-toothwide, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Select import options"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-05-select_delim.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-05a-select_tab.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-06-select_datatypes.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-07-select_worksheet.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-08-loaded.png")
```

At this point the data are in six columns, identified as a combination of supplement (`VC` or `OJ`) and supplement dose (one of `0.5`, `1`, or `2` mg/day). Each measurement is tooth length from a single guinea pig.

To create the box-and-whisker plot, select the complete dataset (including headers), then click on `Insert` and select the statistical plots button from the ribbon, then the `Box-and-Whisker` option in the dropdown menu.

```{r fig-select-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Select box-and-whisker plot"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-09-select_data.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-10-statgraph.png")
```

This will generate a new graph in your worksheet.

The graph is, by default, not informatively-labelled.

- Use the `Add Chart Element` $\rightarrow$ `Legend` $\rightarrow$ `Right` menu to add a legend to the graph. 
- Double-click on the chart title to edit it
- Select and delete the uninformative horizontal axis label

```{r fig-clean-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Tidy plot details"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-11-legend.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-12-title.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-13-axis.png")
```

This looks OK, and the interpretation is straightforward enough:

- Increasing supplement dose looks to be correlated with tooth growth
- At 2mg/day both supplements are associated with similar tooth growth
- There appears to be a straightforward relationship between tooth length and dosage where increaseing supplement dosage is associated with increasing tooth length, for both supplements
- At lower dosages, `OJ` appears to be associated with greater tooth length
- The mean (cross) and median (line) values do not coincide, so the data may be skewed/non-normal
- There is a single outlier in the `VC_1` data

but we could do better with the colours. As the supplement choice is _categorical_ data, we can colour `OJ` and `VC` consistently, but differently: orange for `OJ` and green for `VC`. We can then use different _intensities_ (or _saturation_) to imply variation in dosage, so that more intense colours imply stronger dosage.

To change the colour of a box/whisker combination, click on the box and choose `Format Data Series...` then change the colours as appropriate. 

```{r fig-colour-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Recolour data series"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-14-select_series.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-15-format_dialog.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-16-format_sidepanel.png")
```

With the `Format Data Series` side panel open, you can colour each of the other data series, to obtain a final graph.

```{r fig-final-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Final graph"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-17-final.png")
```


## Linear regression

The `Prestige` dataset is described in the [introduction notebook](./workshop-visualisation.html). It describes a set of occupations - one per row (observations) - with variables describing properties of each occupation, such as percentage of women, the "prestige" of the occupation, and the average number of years in education of a person in that occupation.

Here, we will use `Excel` to load in the dataset and model the relationship between prestige and years in education, using a linear relationship. We'd like to overlay a line describing the relationship, with some statistical information about goodness of fit and the inferred parameters of the model (_gradient_ and _intercept_).


- Create a new `Blank`Workbook` in Excel

```{r fig-create-blank-excel-reg, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Create a blank workbook in `Excel`"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-01-create_blank.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-02-create_blank.png")
```

- Use `File` $\rightarrow$ `Import` to begin the file import wizard.
- Navigate to and select the `prestige.tab` file

```{r fig-select-prestige, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Select data file for import"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-03-select_csv.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-18-select_prestige.png")
```

- Using the wizard, identify the file delimiter, set the column datatypes, and import the data into the current worksheet.

<div id="warning">
**The first column has no header**

To import the data correctly, you must select both the `Tab` and `Space` delimiter options.
</div>

```{r fig-open-prestige, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Select import options"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-19-select_delim.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-20-select_delim.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-21-select_datatypes.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-07-select_worksheet.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-22-loaded.png")
```

Select the `education` and `prestige` columns, then click on `Insert` $\rightarrow$ 'Scatterplot`. This will create a scatterplot in the worksheet.

```{r fig-plot-prestige, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Create scatterplot"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-23-scatterplot.png")
```

To add a regression model, left-click on any of the datapoints in the graph, then right-click to bring up the context menu, and select `Add trendline...` The `Format Trendline` side panel will appear. Ensure that the `Linear` model is selected, and that `Display Equation on chart` and `Display R-squared value on chart` are checked (this adds the regression equation to the plot).

```{r fig-plot-trendline, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Create trendline"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-24-selectpoints.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-25-trendline.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-26-equation.png")
```

The model fit looks plausible, and has $r^2$ value 0.7228, which indicates a moderately strong positive correlation (around 30% of the variation in the value of job prestige cannot be explained solely by the average time spent in education). But the graph needs some attention before it is ready.

We need to add meaningful $x$- and $y$-axis labels, and to improve the title. To rewrite the title, click on the graph element and write in a new title. To obtain axis title elements that you can edit in the same way, click on `Add Chart Element` $\rightarrow$ `Axis Titles` $\rightarrow$ `More Axis Title Options...`. Then edit the axis labels accordingly.

```{r fig-plot-linear-final, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Cleaning up the graph"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-27-axis_options.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-28-final.png")
```

The fitted equation implies that each additional year of education is associated with an increased apparent occupational prestige of around 5.3 units. The model also implies that zero years of education results in an apparent occupational prestige of -10.7 units (which you may or may not think is appropriate in the context of the model).

<div id="warning">
`Excel` gives us an equation for a linear regression, but it does not provide us with any information about _uncertainty_ or _confidence_. What range of lines are _plausible_ fits to the data? What are the reasonable ranges of estimates of _intercept_ and _gradient_?

We can't know from this analysis, but `Excel` 365 does provide an `Analysis ToolPak` which can give you that information.
</div>

<details>
  <summary>Click to toggle information about the `Analysis Toolpak` output</summary>
  
Select the data (not the headers) in columns `B` (`education`) and `E` (`prestige`). Then click on `Data` $\rightarrow$ `Data Analysis` $\rightarrow$ `Regression` to get the dialogue box.

```{r fig-reg-dialog, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regression dialogue box"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-29-regression_dialogue.png")
```

Clicking `OK` gives a new worksheet with more information about the linear regression than can be obtained through `Excel`'s usual plots.

```{r fig-reg-output, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regression output"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/excelvis-30-regression_output.png")
```

This worksheet shows us that the 95% confidence interval for the intercept runs between -18 and -3.4, and the confidence interval for the gradient is in the range 4.7 to 6.

The worksheet also presents useful diagnostic plots of residuals and Normal probability that help us assess whether the regression was appropriate. Such graphs are always worth generating to see if they indicate problems with the data or the model (though a discussion is beyond the scope of this workshop).
