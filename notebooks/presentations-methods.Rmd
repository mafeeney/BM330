<div id="summary">
- A scientific poster helps to communicate the results of a particular study to an audience 
  - A poster should help the presenter communicate (serve as a visual aid/memory prompt), but should also be able to stand alone (communicate the work done without the author present to explain it)
- A poster should generally contain a title, list of authors, and several sections presenting the work: introduction, materials and methods, results, conclusions/significance
</div>

# Materials and Methods sections

- Gives enough information for the reader to understand how the experiments were done
- Gives key parameters for the methods done, but not necessarily as detailed as a paper/thesis
- Often uses a figure/flow diagram to illustrate methods

## Methods Figures (flow diagrams)

```{r methods-fig,  out.width="60%", out.height="60%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="An example of a methods figure (in this case, for Southern blotting [from NIH](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Southern-Blot))"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/southern_blot.jpg")
```

<div id="note">
The titles of the subsections on a poster may not match the sections listed above. For example, it is best to have clear, specific, focused titles that state the take-home message of a section (e.g., "Drug X decreases lymphocyte survival" instead of "Results").
