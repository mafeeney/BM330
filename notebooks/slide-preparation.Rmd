# Introduction



# How to Prepare your Slides

## First Draft

Once you have decided what information needs to be included in your talk, you may find it helpful to draw a rough sketch or outline (on paper or electronically) identifying what conttent you will include in each slide.


You can then start assembling the slide deck, adding images and text using the software of your choice. 

## Software

PowerPoint is perhaps the most commonly used software, but you may use any software you like to prepare your talk.


## Adding Figures and Other Content

### Resolution


You want to keep in mind the size your figures will be printed at, and how they will appear at that resolution. The best practice here is to save images as vector files (.svg files) wherever possible, and for bitmaps use a suitable dpi for printing at A0 size, otherwise you can end up with very pixellated/poor quality images.

You can convert bitmaps to vector images in Adobe Illustrator/similar.


## Editing your poster

Once you have prepared a first draft of your poster, you will need to edit it. Practice presenting your poster in front of friends and/or colleagues, and note what works well (and what doesn't). Improve your poster based on their feedback. 

Things to keep in mind while you are editing your poster: 

- Remove any text or figures that do not help you present your project 
- Add any information that was missing (e.g., to answer any questions that your audience asked during your practice presentations)
- Consider the overall aesthetics of your poster (e.g., is the colour scheme working well, is there enough whitespace, does the reader naturally move through the sections in the intended order?)

# Some PowerPoint Tips
- It can be helpful to group objects 
- Overly fancy animations or slide transitions are distracting to your audience - keep it simple
- Edit the "slide master" template
