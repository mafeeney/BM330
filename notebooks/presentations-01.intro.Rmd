# Introduction

This is a companion guide to the BM330 workshop A (Classic Paper Journal Club). We have collated some information and helpful tips that will assist you in preparing your journal club presentation. However, reading these tips is not a substitute for attending workshop A - where we will discuss the classic paper journal club in more detail.

# The Anatomy of a Journal Club Presentation

Every talk is different, and all of the classic papers are different - but every journal club talk should contain the following elements in some form: 
- An explanation of the problem that the authors were trying to solve, and the historical context they were working in (what was known before the authors began this study, and what they were trying to achieve)
- A description of the work that was done (this should include materials & methods/experimental design, results and conclusions)
- An explanation of the significance of the work (what other work was made possible because of this paper? how did it change our understanding of microbiology?)
- Critical analysis of the paper (including, but not limited to: limitations of the experimental design, controls, alternative experimental approaches...)

Boiled down to the essentials, your presentation should inform your audience of why your assigned paper is important; describe the aims/hypothesis of your work, what experiments were done and how, and the overall conclusions/"take-home messages"; and help your audience understand the historical context and significance of the paper.

## Content

- A short description of what the slide is about. May be a declarative statement of what the research has found, or a descriptive statement of what the research is about.

## Data (Figures and Tables, mostly)

- Authors are usually listed directly below the title
- Everyone who has contributed to the work should be listed
- The person who prepared the poster (you) should be listed first, and the supervisor last
- Institutional affiliations should also be listed (e.g., University of Strathclyde)

## Aesthetics

- Gives enough background for the reader to understand your research question and why it is important. 
- Clearly sets out the aims and hypothesis for the work

# Preparing slides and delivering a talk

- Gives enough information for the reader to understand how the experiments were done
- Gives key parameters for the methods done, but not necessarily as detailed as a paper/thesis
- Often uses a figure/flow diagram to illustrate methods

# Preparing for Questions and Feedback

- Includes key results that answer the stated hypothesis/research aims
- Uses subheadings to break into subsections as necessary
- Uses graphs or charts where necessary to illustrate key points

# FAQ

- 1-3 clear, concise "take home" messages for your audience
- Usually relating back to the aims/hypothesis defined earlier
- May use a model figure to summarize results/put results in context
