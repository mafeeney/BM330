# How to Prepare your Slides

## First Draft

Once you have decided what information needs to be included in your talk, you may find it helpful to draw a rough sketch or outline (on paper or electronically) identifying what content you will include in each slide.


You can then start assembling the slide deck, adding images and text using the software of your choice. 

## Software

PowerPoint is perhaps the most commonly used software, but you may use any software you like to prepare your talk.


## Adding Figures and Other Content

- Make sure that any figures you add are 

### Resolution

- You want to keep in mind the size your figures will be displayed at, and how they will appear at that size/resolution. 

You can convert bitmaps to vector images in Adobe Illustrator/similar.

### Animation


## Editing your slides

- Once you have prepared a first draft of your slides, you will need to edit it. 

- Practice presenting your slides in front of friends and/or colleagues, and note what works well (and what doesn't). Improve your slides based on their feedback. 

- Things to keep in mind while you are editing your poster: 

  - Remove any text or figures that do not help you present your paper 
  - Add any information that was missing (e.g., to answer questions that your audience asked during your practice presentations)
  - Consider the overall aesthetics of your poster (e.g., is the colour scheme working well, is there enough whitespace, does the reader naturally move through the sections in the intended order?)

# Some PowerPoint Tips

- It can be helpful to group objects so that you can move them/manipulate them all at once.

- Overly fancy animations or slide transitions are distracting to your audience - keep it simple.

- Edit the "slide master" template to make overall changes to font or style that apply to every slide in your presentation.
