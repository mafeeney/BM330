- Your figures should be clear and informative, allowing the reader to easily and quickly understand the data that you present.
- Design decisions, including layout and the use of white space, colour choices, font size and choice, all matter in terms of making your figure clear and easy to interpret.

# Introduction

You are the author of your figures: not their intended audience. It is important, when you create any figure, to take a few moments to consider how a naive audience (one who hasn't seen the figure before) will perceive it. 

It is also essential that you consider *accessibility*: is your figure accessible to a broad audience? Or does it rely on niche jargon specific to a particular field, colour palettes that are difficult/impossible for some readers to see, and/or fonts that are difficult for some readers to read?

Unfortunately, many scientific figures are poorly designed. They are difficult to interpret, confuse the reader, and/or distract from the message that the authors mean to convey.

```

<div id="warning">
Do not mislead your audience!

# Figure aesthetics

Your audience will form an impression of your figure within the first 30 seconds (or less) of looking at it. 

# Colors

Do not use colour for the sake of using colour.^[For practical reasons, if nothing else: print journals usually charge additional money to print colour figures.] Poor colour choices can distort our visual perception of the data, making it harder for the reader to correctly interpret a figure. In the example shown below, it is much easier to see the differences in height clearly when the chart is in gray; using colours, here, can distort our perceptions.

```{r finaldoc, fig.cap="Pointless use of colour, From: [Junk Charts](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2021/06/distorting-perception-versus-distorting-the-data.html)"}
