## How do I use this repository?

If you are a student on BM432, you should not need to use this repository, but we make it available in the spirit of open science.

As tutors, we use the code and materials in this repository to generate:

1. standalone HTML files that can be used with MyPlace
2. `Shiny` webapps that can be run by students on their own machines, or at `rstudio.org`

The material is written in `R` using `R Markdown`, and to work with or generate all the materials, we recommend that you install and use `RStudio`.
